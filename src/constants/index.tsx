      '<p><pre><code>    24 hour subway leaves no time at all to do any maintenance.\n</code></pre>\nThis is incorrect.  The NYC subway has a huge amount of extra tracks (side tracks and local&#x2F;express tracks).  I would hazard a guess to say more than any other system in the world.  (How many other systems in the world have so many local &amp; express tracks?  It is incredibly rare.)  This allows them to run maintenance at night, while there are much fewer regular trains running.  This is partly why you need to wait so long for a train between 2 AM and 6 AM.  A long time ago when I lived in NYC, during these &quot;dead hours&quot;, waiting at a station, I would frequently see maintenance trains passing through the station.<p>To me, the real purpose of 24 hour train service is make the city a &quot;24 hour city&quot; -- for economic purposes.  People working late shifts in office buildings (cleaners, maintenance) or factories (food, clothing, whatever) or restaurants&#x2F;bars&#x2F;nightlife can all use a very cheap, albeit slow, delayed, and low quality, metro 24 hours a day.  What is strange to me: Why not replace nice service with bus service?  It would be cheaper to run and they could spend more time maintaining the tracks below.<p>Last question: How many 24x7x365 metro systems exist in the world?  I struggle to think of five.',

          '<p><pre><code>    24 hour subway leaves no time at all to do any maintenance.\n</code></pre>\nThis is incorrect.  The NYC subway has a huge amount of extra tracks (side tracks and local/express tracks).  I would hazard a guess to say more than any other system in the world.  (How many other systems in the world have so many local &amp; express tracks?  It is incredibly rare.)  This allows them to run maintenance at night, while there are much fewer <em>regular</em> trains running.  This is partly why you need to wait so long for a train between 2 AM and 6 AM.  A long time ago when I lived in NYC, during these &quot;dead hours&quot;, waiting at a station, I would frequently see maintenance trains passing through the station.<p>To me, the real purpose of 24 hour train service is make the city a &quot;24 hour city&quot; -- for economic purposes.  People working late shifts in office buildings (cleaners, maintenance) or factories (food, clothing, whatever) or restaurants/bars/nightlife can all use a very cheap, albeit slow, delayed, and low quality, metro 24 hours a day.  What is strange to me: Why not replace nice service with bus service?  It would be cheaper to run and they could spend more time maintaining the tracks below.<p>Last question: How many 24x7x365 metro systems exist in the world?  I struggle to think of five.',

In terms of using it as a build system, it’s lacking unless you put in the legwork. The default is to use other build systems within Nix, but that leads to a lot of unnecessary rebuilding during development, so we just span up our own Bazel-like library for Nix to do the heavy lifting.',
